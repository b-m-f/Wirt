# Frequently asked questions

## Is my WirtBot secure when exposed?

By design yes. The WirtBot only accepts payloads from the Interface that are signed with the trusted public key.

But there might always be Bugs in the Source Code, so if you want to make sure that you are secure it is best to restrict access to the Interface and WirtBot Core with Firewall rules.

Only allowing access from the WireGuard interface for example will ensure that only your trusted network devices can talk to it.
