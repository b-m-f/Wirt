# Setup

## Dependencies

To set up a WirtBot you must first make sure that your machine has the following dependencies installed:

- Linux Kernel > 5.6 or the WireGuardÂ® Kernel Module
- Docker
- docker-compose

## Initial setup

Here is an example `docker-compose.yml` for a WirtBot with DNS:

```
version: "3.4"

services:
  WirtBot:
    image: bmff/wirtbot:test
    network_mode: host
    container_name: WirtBot
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 3030:3030
      - 10101:10101/udp
    restart: "unless-stopped"
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    volumes:
      - /etc/wireguard:/etc/wireguard
      - ./data:/dns
    environment:
      - "PORT=3030"
      - "MANAGED_DNS_ENABLED=1"
      - "MANAGED_DNS_DEVICE_FILE=/dns/Corefile"
      - "CONFIG_PATH=/etc/wireguard/server.conf"
  coredns:
    network_mode: host
    image: coredns/coredns
    container_name: WirtBotDNS
    ports:
      - 53:53/udp
    restart: "unless-stopped"
    working_dir: /v
    volumes:
      - ./data:/v
```

Copy this configuration into a file on the machine and run `docker-compose up -d`.
Docker will now take care of downloading the WirtBot and CoreDNS containers and wiring them up.

You can check the progress with `docker logs -f WirtBot`.
Once the setup is finished you should see a message like this:

```
A new keypair for communication between Core and UI was generated
Please import the following text into your dashboard to take control of this WirtBot
```

followed by a long string.

To take control of the WirtBot via your browser you can now reach the Interface at the IP address of your machine in the browser.
Simple paste the above mentioned string into the input box that should be shown to you and click on the `Connect` button.

Done. You are now in control of the WirtBot via your browser.

## Setting up your network

Now it is time to set up your network. Fill out the server section first, according to your needs. In the example configuration WireGuard will be listening at Port 10101.

After adding the server go ahead and add as many devices as you want.
Once the network is established you might want to start closin down the Interface via Firewall rules.
