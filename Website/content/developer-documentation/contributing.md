# Contributing

## Git

### Branches

The main branch that is also always deployed to docker images is the `master` branch

Any work should be done on feature branches. When the work is done a pull request has to be opened to request that the changes will be accepted into master and released.

## Testing

Make sure to include tests with your changes.
If the code you submit adds or changes functionality this should be covered by a test.

Pull requests without tests might be rejected for that reason.
