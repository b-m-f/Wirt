# What is a WirtBot?

The WirtBot is the central piece to create a system that will allow secure communication between any devices you might have - over the internet.

It is designed in 2 parts, a WirtBotÂ® running on a server and the WirtBot Interface to configure it.

- Head over <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/documentation/how-does-it-work">here</a> to understand how it works.
- Check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/documentation/setup">this page</a> to set it up yourself
- The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/documentation/setup">FAQ page</a> should hopefully answer any other questions


## Who build this?

For the beginning that would be me, [b-m-f](https://ehlers.berlin).
But I hope that many people will like the project and help improve it over the years and they will be added here.

Still got questions? Reach me at `contact at wirt.network`.
