## Setup

### Prerequisites

Your server must support `systemd` to control processes.

### Installation

#### Compilation

- Install rust and cargo with https://rustup.rs/ or your preferred installation method.
- `cargo build --release`

### Using the WirtBot

- Place the `target/release/wirtbot` executable from your compilation, or a release from the [release page](https://github.com/b-m-f/WirtBot/releases) into `/usr/bin` or `/bin` on your server.
- Generate the public key from your [wirt](https://wirt.network/settings) webapp
- Create a new user that is allowed to change the config at `/etc/wireguard/server.conf`
- Copy the example `wirtbot.service` config to `/etc/systemd/system/` and update it with the correct values
- Start and enable the service with `systemctl enable --now wirtbot`

#### Automatically restarting wireguard

- install `inotify-tools`
- Place the `wireguard-restarter.sh` script to `/usr/bin` and make it executable (`chmod +x /usr/bin/wireguard-restarter.sh`)
- Copy the example `wireguard-restarter.service` config to `/etc/systemd/system/` and update it with the correct values
- Start and enable the service with `systemctl enable --now wireguard-restarter`

### Configuring your WirtBot

The WirtBot is configured with environment variables:

- **PUBLIC_KEY**: Public key of your https://wirt.network app
- **SSL_PEM_CERT**: SSL certificate
- **SSL_KEY**: SSL private key for the certificate

#### Optional

- **HOST**: the host address to listen on
- **PORT**: the port to listen on
- **CONFIG_PATH**: path to your Wireguard configuration
- **MANAGED_DNS_ENABLED**: Enable endpoint to configure DNS
- **MANAGED_DNS_DEVICE_FILE**: File to write DNS entries to. (default: `/etc/wirt_devices`)

## Contributing

Simply check the `src/main.rs` file for **TODO** comments, to see what can be optimized in the code.

If you have other ideas please open a PR for small improvements.

For bigger changes, lets discuss these in an issue first.

### Other TODOs

- Testing needs to be done. One sample test to show how to test filters is implemented

## Development

In order to develop the WirtBot you need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
The docker container has all necessary setup already done, allowing you to focus on the actual task you want to do.

### Allow localhost in CORS

Make sure to send requests with the origin set to `https://wirt.network`.

For example in curl: `curl -H "origin: https://wirt.network"`

### Testing

Run `make test`

### Continuous Testing

Run `make test-dev`

### Logging

To enable logging run the program with the wanted environment variable.
Check [env-logger](https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.7.1/env_logger/) for more information.

#### Server logs

`RUST_LOG=wirt::api`. For example `RUST_LOG=wirt::api cargo run`
