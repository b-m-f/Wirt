# WirtBot system tests

These tests are responsible for testing the WirtBot as a whole.


The testing setup consists of multiple docker container that are composed with `docker-compose`.

The container mesh represents a typical WirtBot setup against which test containers can be spawned to verify that the system works correctly.
